# Changelog

All notable changes to Fish Tweak Tool are documented here. Newest first.

## 2026.06.27

### What Changed

- **M0 scaffold.** Stood up the standalone GTK4 / PyGObject application: it
  launches an empty tabbed shell (Prompt · Plugins · Themes · Settings) ready for
  the M1–M4 milestones to fill in. No fish config is touched yet — this is
  structure only.

### Technical Details

- Mirrors the alacritty-tweak-tool layout: `usr/bin/` launcher, `usr/share/`
  Python, `usr/share/applications/` desktop entry.
- App modules are prefixed `ftt_` to avoid colliding with fish's real
  `fish_config` / `fish_prompt` / `fish_theme` commands. Entry point keeps the
  hyphenated `fish-tweak-tool.py` name (executed, never imported).
- `fish-tweak-tool.py` — `Gtk.Application` (id `com.kiro.fish-tweak-tool`),
  headerbar, CSS load, UTF-8 re-exec guard, window-size persistence.
- `ftt_gui.py` — builds the four-tab `Gtk.Notebook` with "Coming soon"
  placeholder pages.
- `ftt_config.py` — app preferences only (`~/.config/fish-tweak-tool/prefs.json`);
  deliberately does **not** write to `~/.config/fish/` (that arrives with M1+).
- `log.py` — colored console logging (shared pattern across Kiro tools).
- Launcher checks for `python3` and `fish`; drops alacritty's `tomlkit` check
  (fish config is plain fish, not TOML).
- Desktop entry uses `Icon=fish` as a placeholder — final icon is an open
  decision.
